Right column: Our stroke-control CT ('scCT') template based on 30 individuals without brain injury who had a high resolution CT scan. Note that for normalization this image is blurred with a 8mm FWHM. Our second aim was to create a MRI template that would match the approximate size and shape of our CT template. While participants in studies of adult stroke have a mean age in their 60s (e.g. Karnath et al., 2004, 2011), most lesion mapping studies normalize data to the same MNI152 template that is distributed with popular packages such as SPM and FSL (Collins et al., 1994). According to the SPM source code, this template is based on 152 individuals (86 male) with a mean age of 25 (median=24, stdev=4.9). Therefore, the MNI152 template shows less age-related atrophy (wide sulci, large ventricles) than the average adult stroke patient. On one hand, using the MNI152 template is very useful, as it does provide a close correspondence between stroke studies and the majority of neuroimaging studies that are conducted on young individuals. On the other hand, the nonlinear functions employed creating an age-specific template for stroke patients will provide a more representative image of the actual extent and location of injury. In any case, as our CT template was drawn from a clinical aging adult population, the CT template necessarily had larger ventricles than previous templates based on young adults. Therefore, our aim was to create a MRI template that matched our CT template. The benefit of this strategy is that the resulting templates can be used in studies where mixed modalities are present (though it should be noted that the precise shape of the templates will vary slightly and that the extent of apparent injury varies across modality, requiring caution for mixed modality studies).",,True,False,Mask,"{'doi': '10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.03.020', 'doi_url': 'https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.03.020', 'oa': {'is_oa': True, 'oa_status': 'green', 'journal_is_oa': False, 'journal_is_in_doaj': False, 'license': None, 'provenance': 'unpaywall'}}",81,343,0,figure 1  ct template image  left column  transmission scan distributed spm based pet transmission scan 11 young adult  note poor subcortical definition  middle column  able ’ template based skullstripped lowresolution ct scan single healthy young adult  right column  strokecontrol ct  ‘ scct ’  template based 30 individual without brain injury high resolution ct scan  note normalization image blurred 8mm fwhm
